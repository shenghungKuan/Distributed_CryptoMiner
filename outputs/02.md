## Test 02: Thread Creation [1 pts]

Ensures the program creates the desired number of threads

```

timeout 1 ./miner 0 32 'Test Case 2' &> /dev/null
result=${?}
if [[ ${result} -ne 1 ]]; then
    echo "Return was: ${result}; should be 1 (invalid number of threads)"
    test_end 1
fi

timeout 1 ./miner bananas 32 'Test Case 2' &> /dev/null
result=${?}
if [[ ${result} -ne 1 ]]; then
    echo "Return was: ${result}; should be 1 (invalid number of threads)"
    test_end 1
fi
